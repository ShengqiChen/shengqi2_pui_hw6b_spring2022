                <h3>CONSENT TO TREAT<hr></h3>
                <br>
<p>I voluntarily give my consent to Carnegie Mellon University Health Services (UHS), and any such medical provider, assistant, nurse, or allied health professional student employed or participating in a clinical rotation with UHS, to provide medical services to me. I am authorizing UHS to treat me during my relationship with Carnegie Mellon, be it as an enrolled student, employee, or visiting scholar/researcher, until I withdraw my consent in writing.<br></p>

<p>I acknowledge that I am responsible for all charges in connection with the medical care and services provided by UHS and its representatives and agree to pay for any services provided at UHS at the time of appointment or upon receipt of a billing statement. I also understand that I am financially responsible for all charges incurred for any and all services received outside of UHS. I approve the release of medical diagnostic information to my insurance company for payment purposes.</p><br>

<p>I hereby certify that I have read fully the above authorization and that no guarantee has been made as to the result that may be obtained from the provision of a medical service.</p><br>

<p>In addition, I acknowledge that I have received the Carnegie Mellon University Health Services Notice of Privacy Practices document. I also understand that additional copies of this notice are available for my review upon request.</p><br>

<p>I further understand that such information may be deemed to be personally identifiable information from my student records and/or treatment records pursuant to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and other applicable privacy laws.</p><br>

<h3>COVID-19 Testing Provisions:</h3><br>

<p>I understand that by coming to Pittsburgh for in-person instruction, research and campus engagement, I agreed to the rules set forth in "A Tartan's Responsibility", including contributing to the identification of COVID-19 and supporting the containment of COVID-19. If UHS has advised that I be evaluated and/or tested for COVID-19, I understand that I am expected to follow all guidance and direction provided to support my health and well-being as well as the community's.</p><br>

<p>I hereby authorize officials in UHS to share, discuss and exchange information with representatives within the Division of Student Affairs and/or others as authorized under FERPA for the purpose of confirming:</p><br>

<ol>
<li>the outcome of my COVID-19 clinical evaluation;</li>

<li>housing, dining, and academic accommodation services you may need to support you during your recovery; and</li>

<li>recommendations for further support and the reason for those recommendations.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Despite the fact that my student medical records are subject to FERPA and are separate and distinct from external patient medical records (which are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)), I acknowledge and agree that records related to COVID testing while I am a student at CMU may be documented in an external patient medical record system maintained by Allegheny Health Network pursuant to an agreement between CMU and Allegheny Clinic.</p>

<p>My consent to this disclosure will expire (1) year from today's date. In addition, I may revoke my consent at any time upon written request to UHS. However, I understand that information may still be disclosed without my consent where permitted by applicable privacy laws, such as FERPA.</p><br>
